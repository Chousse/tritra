# Triangle Tracker

A simple library for identifying isosceles triangles within a set of 2d points.

## Motivation

I was working on building an interactive touchscreen table with object recognition features. This concept uses marker discs with a distinct isosceles triangle pattern to distinguish objects, therefore I needed a library to handle all the math for identifying and tracking these triangles.

## Features



## Installation

$ npm i --save tritra
```
